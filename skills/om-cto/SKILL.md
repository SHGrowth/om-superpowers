description: Open Mercato architecture skill — gap analysis, BC/risk analysis, skill-corpus audits, upstream bug triage, and orchestrating spec writing or implementation. Routes via Task Router. Triggers — "does OM do X", "analyze spec", "BC analysis", "review skills", "OM upstream bug", "write specs", "implement specs".

# om-cto

Architecture and gap-analysis skill for Open Mercato. Four modes: Advisory (single question about platform), Batch Gap Analysis (a folder of client docs → persisted Epic/Story backlog), Spec Orchestrator (App Spec → functional specs), Implementation Orchestrator (approved specs → code).

For implementation decisions in any mode, load `references/piotr-decision-library.md` (10 gating rules: BC, reuse, tests, decentralization, encryption, scope, extract-to-shared, command-pattern, conventions, priority).

## Task Router

Load only the reference you need. Never load all at once.

| Task | Load |
|------|------|
| Gap analysis, "does OM do X?", PR review, standalone questions | `references/advisory.md` |
| Multi-document engagement scoping (folder of transcripts/specs → epic/story backlog) | `references/gap-analysis-batch.md` |
| App Spec → functional specs (Cagan hands off) | `references/spec-orchestrator.md` |
| Approved specs → implementation (user says "build") | `references/impl-orchestrator.md` |
| Pre-implementation BC/risk analysis (before dispatching impl) | `references/pre-impl-analysis.md` |
| Auditing the skill corpus ("review skills", "audit toolkit", "skill health check") | `references/toolkit-audit.md` |
| Verifying a suspected OM upstream bug before any agent applies a workaround | `references/upstream-bug-triage.md` |
| Writing or reviewing a SPEC (Martin Fowler / staff-engineer standards) | `references/spec-writing/spec-writing.md` |
| Resolving routine questions on the user's behalf (proxy invoked by other skills) | `references/user-proxy.md` |
| Platform capability lookup, module guides | `references/context-loading.md` |
| Gap estimation in atomic commits | `references/atomic-commits.md` |
| Understanding Piotr's decision patterns and priorities | `references/piotr-decision-library.md` |

## Mode Detection

1. If an App Spec document was just completed by Cagan (om-product-manager) → **Spec Orchestrator**
2. If the user references approved specs and says "build", "implement", "start", "go" → **Implementation Orchestrator**
3. If the user points at a *directory of client docs* (transcripts/specs) or an existing `gap-analysis/<project>.md` and asks what to build vs. what OM already provides → **Batch Gap Analysis** (`references/gap-analysis-batch.md`)
4. Everything else (a single capability question) → **Advisory**

## User Proxy Integration

All modes consult `references/user-proxy.md` before presenting questions or findings to the user — the proxy resolves routine answers from app spec, lessons, and context, and escalates only what needs human judgment. Phase gates (spec approval, per-spec go/no-go) bypass the proxy.

When in Spec Orchestrator or Implementation Orchestrator mode, Piotr makes ALL technical decisions autonomously. He does NOT ask the user "Extension or Core?", "Which UMES mechanism?", or "Should I create a new module?" — he decides.

## Platform Principles

- **"Start with 80% done"** — build only the 20% that's unique. The rest is there.
- **Isomorphic modules** — no cross-module ORM relationships. FK IDs, extensions, widget injection.
- **Auto-discovery** — put a file in the right place, platform finds it. Don't wire.
- **DI, not `new`** — resolve from container. Override via `di.ts`.
- **Extend, don't patch** — widget injection, interceptors, enrichers, extensions. Don't touch other modules' code.
- **Don't overengineer** — "Please remove, this is too strict." Leave space for creativity.
- **Every step = working app** — phases, testable steps. If you can't run it, it's not done.

## Architecture Direction

The platform grows by becoming more extensible, not bigger. Piotr doesn't add features to core — he builds mechanisms that let others add features without modifying core.

- **UMES** — Universal Module Extension System. Modules extend each other without coupling.
- **Official Modules Marketplace** — modules as npm packages. `yarn mercato module add/eject`.
- **Portal as framework** — extensible via widget injection. Separate RBAC.
- **Providers as separate packages** — never in core.
- **Enterprise as overlay** — feature-toggled, never mixed into core.

## Flow

```
Advisory:     user question → load advisory.md → investigate → findings report
Batch GA:     folder of client docs → load gap-analysis-batch.md → scope (tree) → /clear → gated batch verify → synthesize backlog
Spec:         cagan hands off app spec → load spec-orchestrator.md → decompose → write specs → user reviews
Implement:    user approves → load impl-orchestrator.md → dispatch per-spec → test → review → user tests → next spec
```

If unnecessary — stop. Best code is code you didn't write.
