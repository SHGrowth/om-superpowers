# Toolkit Review

Audit the OM superpowers skill corpus for context efficiency, structural health, and upstream alignment. Produces a prioritized report with concrete fixes.

## When to Run

- After adding or significantly editing a skill
- Periodic hygiene (monthly or after a burst of skill work)
- When conversations feel slow or context-starved during orchestrator chains
- Before cutting a new plugin release

## Audit Dimensions

Run all dimensions. Report findings per dimension with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low).

### 1. Size Budget

Measure every SKILL.md and reference file. Context is finite — every token in a skill is a token not available for code.

```bash
find skills -name "*.md" -exec wc -c {} \; | sort -rn
find skills -name "SKILL.md" -exec wc -c {} + | tail -1
find skills -name "*.md" -exec wc -c {} + | tail -1
```

**Thresholds:**

| Metric | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Single SKILL.md | < 12KB | 12-20KB | > 20KB |
| SKILL.md + its references | < 25KB | 25-40KB | > 40KB |
| Total corpus (all SKILL.md) | < 150KB | 150-250KB | > 250KB |
| Total corpus (all .md) | < 250KB | 250-350KB | > 350KB |

**Why these thresholds:** A full orchestrator chain (om-cto → implement-spec → code-review → tests) can load 5-8 skills. At 20KB each, that's 100-160KB of skill text before any code is read. On 200K-token models, skill instructions should stay under ~25% of context.

### 2. Rule Duplication vs. Upstream

OM platform conventions live in `om-reference/AGENTS.md` and per-module AGENTS.md files. Skills that re-state these rules waste context and create maintenance drift.

**Process:**
1. Read `om-reference/AGENTS.md` — extract the key rules (tenant isolation, naming, exports, etc.)
2. For each SKILL.md, grep for rules that duplicate upstream AGENTS.md content
3. Flag any rule that appears in 3+ skills verbatim

**Common duplicates to check:**

| Rule pattern | Grep for |
|-------------|----------|
| Tenant isolation | `organization_id.*tenant_id`, `tenant.scop` |
| No cross-module ORM | `cross-module.*ORM`, `ManyToOne.*across`, `FK IDs only` |
| openApi export | `export.*openApi`, `MUST export.*openApi` |
| CrudForm/DataTable only | `CrudForm.*never custom`, `DataTable.*never.*table` |
| No `any` types | `No.*any.*zod`, `z\.infer` |
| i18n rules | `useT\(\).*hardcoded`, `resolveTranslations` |
| ACL feature format | `id.*title.*module` |
| Event naming | `module\.entity\.past_tense` |
| BC 13-category table | `contract surface`, `13.*categories` |

**Verdict:**
- Rule in 1 skill + upstream AGENTS.md → **redundant**, remove from skill
- Rule in 3+ skills but NOT in upstream → candidate for a shared `references/om-coding-rules.md`
- Rule in 1 skill only → fine, leave it

### 3. Template-to-Logic Ratio

Skills should be decision logic + workflow. Code templates belong in `references/`.

**Process:** For each SKILL.md over 15KB, estimate:
- Lines of TypeScript/TSX code blocks
- Lines of decision logic, workflow steps, rules

**Threshold:** If code templates exceed 50% of SKILL.md, they should move to `references/templates.md`.

**Check which skills follow the right pattern:**
- om-cto: lean task router in SKILL.md, mode workflows in references — **ideal pattern**
- Compare other skills against this pattern

### 4. Trigger Overlap

Multiple skills matching the same user intent causes wrong-skill invocation.

**Process:**
1. Extract all `description:` fields from SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Build a trigger matrix: for common user phrases, which skills match?

**Test phrases:**

| User says | Should trigger | Should NOT trigger |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| "build this feature" | om-cto (advisory) | om-product-manager |
| "implement the spec" | om-cto (impl orchestrator) | om-product-manager |
| "review this code" | base code-review (synced) | om-cto |
| "create a new module" | om-module-scaffold | om-cto |
| "extend the customers module" | om-system-extension | om-eject-and-customize |
| "write a spec" | om-cto (spec orchestrator) | om-product-manager |
| "add an entity" | om-data-model-design | om-module-scaffold |
| "design the UI" | om-backend-ui-design | om-ux |
| "run tests" | om-integration-tests | om-cto |
| "this doesn't work" | om-troubleshooter | — |

**Verdict:** If two skills both match a phrase, their descriptions need disambiguation. One should clearly say "Use BEFORE X" and the other "Use AFTER X" or "Use WHEN X already exists."

### 5. Stale References

Skills reference files, paths, variables that may not exist or have moved.

**Process:**
```bash
# Find $OM_REPO references (undefined in plugin context)
grep -rn '\$OM_REPO' skills/

# Find .ai/skills/codex/ paths (old structure)
grep -rn '\.ai/skills/codex' skills/

# Find references to files — verify they exist
grep -rnoE 'references/[a-z0-9_-]+\.md' skills/ | while read match; do
  file=$(echo "$match" | sed 's/.*://')
  dir=$(dirname "$(echo "$match" | cut -d: -f1)")
  [ ! -f "$dir/$file" ] && echo "MISSING: $dir/$file (referenced from $match)"
done
```

Also check:
- Cross-skill references (do om-cto dispatch contexts reference base skills correctly?)
- `om-reference/` paths (do referenced AGENTS.md files exist in vendored copy?)

### 6. Chain Context Explosion

When om-cto orchestrates, it chains multiple skills. Estimate total context for each chain.

**Process:** Trace the orchestrator chains:

```
Chain A (Spec Orchestrator):
  om-cto SKILL.md + spec-orchestrator.md + base spec-writing + base pre-implement-spec
  + conditional: om-data-model-design, om-system-extension

Chain B (Implementation Orchestrator — per spec):
  om-cto SKILL.md + impl-orchestrator.md + base implement-spec + base code-review + base integration-tests
  + conditional: om-module-scaffold, om-backend-ui-design,
                 om-system-extension, om-troubleshooter

Chain C (Full pipeline — Chain A then Chain B per spec):
  Sum of all above
```

For each chain, sum the SKILL.md sizes of loaded skills. Compare against context budget (target: < 25% of model context for skills).

**Thresholds:**

| Chain | Budget (200K model) | Budget (1M model) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Single skill invocation | < 30KB | < 30KB |
| Orchestrator chain | < 100KB | < 150KB |
| Full pipeline | < 150KB | < 250KB |

### 7. System Prompt Coverage

Skills exist on disk but may not be listed in the Claude Code system prompt (plugin registration).

**Process:**
```bash
# List all skill directories
ls skills/ | sed 's/^/open-mercato-superpowers:/'

# Compare against what appears in session system-reminder
# (manually check — the skill listing is in the system prompt)
```

**Classify each skill:**
- **User-invocable:** Listed in system prompt, user can invoke directly
- **Internal:** Not listed, only invoked by other skills
- **Orphaned:** Exists on disk, not referenced by any other skill

Internal skills are fine if intentional. Document which are which.

### 8. Skill-to-Skill Consistency

Check that skills that reference each other agree on conventions.

**Process:**
- Do om-cto's dispatch context sections match what the base OM skills actually expect?
- Do pipeline assumptions (impl-orchestrator Pipeline Lock) match what base skills actually do?
- Are synced base skills up to date with OM core develop?

## Rules

- MUST run all 8 audit dimensions — no shortcuts
- MUST produce the structured output format
- MUST check actual file sizes, not estimates
- MUST verify stale references against the filesystem
- MUST trace chains by reading skill cross-references, not from memory
- MUST NOT modify any skill files — this skill is audit-only
- MUST NOT skip upstream comparison — rule duplication vs AGENTS.md is the highest-value check
- Present findings to the user before proposing any changes
